# The COVID Tracking Project

The COVID Tracking Project collects information from 50 US states, the District
of Columbia, and 5 other US territories to provide the most comprehensive
testing data we can collect for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. They attempt
to include positive and negative results, pending tests, and total people
tested for each state or district currently reporting that data.
